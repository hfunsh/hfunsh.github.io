<h1>Pillars of OOP</h1>
<h4>Encapsulation</h4>
<h4>Inheritance</h4> 
<h4>Polymorphism</h4>

<h3>Polymorphism</h3>
<p>* Allows you to write programs that process objects that share the same superclass (either directly or indirectly) as if they were all objects of the same superclass
<p>* We use a superclass reference to manipulate both superclass and subclass objects
<p>* This is because the subtype is also a class of the Supertype
<p>* A subclass is a specialization of the superclass
<p>* Every instance of a subclass is also an instance of a superclass

<p><h2>For example:</h2>
* Suppose we have an animal superclass which is inherited by subclasses Frog, Fish and Bird
* Our superclass would contain a move() method
* This method can be overwritten and implemented differently in all three classes 
* Relying on each method to do what’s right is the key concept of polymorphism
* Polymorphism is the OOP concept that makes this possible 

Declared Type vs Actual Type
Declared Type is the type assigned to the variable at declaration
Actual Type is the type of the object the variable is referred to at run-time

When an object invokes a method, Java searches it’s superclasses for the correct implementation of the method
This concept is known as Dynamic Binding
The method to be invoked is bound at run-time


Extensibility
New classes can be added with little to no modification
Just create the new class and write the code which initializes an instance of the new class object

Interface
* Interfaces allow us to assign common functionality to possibly unrelated classes
* This enables objects of these classes to be processed polymorphically
* Objects of classes that implement the same interface can respond to all of the interface method calls
* Polymorphism enables you to program in generalities and let the run time execution worry about the specifics
* Polymorphism promotes extensibility 
* It allows you to treat an object of a subclass like an object of the superclass
* Cannot invoke subclass methods on superclass objects
* We can however downcast a superclass object to a reference of a subclass 

Examples
Calling a subclass method using a reference to a superclass instance 

aim a superclass reference to a subclass object - this invokes the subclass methods 
demonstrates that an object of a subclass can be treated as n object of it’s superclass
a program can create an array of superclass objects which reference subclass objects


when a superclass variable contains a reference to a subclass variable, the subclass method is called
Dynamic binding - the compiler uses a variable type at runtime to determine which methods to called

Abstract Classes
Purpose is to create a Superclass which contains common functionality for other classes to inherit
Cannot be instantiated to create a new object since they are incomplete


When we make a polymorphic call, the concept responsible for selecting the correct method is Dynamic Binding
Means the compiler will search the superclasses for the appropriate version of the method
An example of that is overriding the toString method in a class
